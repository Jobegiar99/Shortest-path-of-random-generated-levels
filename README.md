# Shortest Path to Exit a Random Generated Level
This is a project in which I developed an algorithm to generate random levels, then I applied A* to traverse a Tile Graph representation of the level to obtain the shortest path from what would be the entrance of the level and the exit.

You can read how the algorithm to generate random level works at:
